<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nicholas Randel, I am a Prior service Marine and am currently working as welder. I am also and aspiring web-developer <br />
  With the hope of becoming a fulltime deveploper in the near future. This is my first website and I cant wait to 
  see the progress I make on this journey.
</p>

<p>I enjoy creating, problem solving, and learning new skills. Some of my hobbies are leather working, custom paint and pinstripping, <br />
  and working on motorcycles. All of these engage me creatively and offer unique and exciting challenges.
  I hope that my unique life experience along with my hobbies can help me to be a well rounded developer <br />
  that can provide unique and engaging websites.

<p>Aside from my personal hobbies and work I also help my wife run a vintage resell bussines. We specialize in 
  mid-century modern furniture and home decor. We refinish each piece in its original style <br />
  to bring new life to beautiful furniture that other wise might be discarded. We have all kinds of decor rangeing 
  from kitchen appliances and dishware, to records and clothing, and everything in between.
